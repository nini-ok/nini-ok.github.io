        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>
            "Minecraft 2D Light" is a two-dimensional version inspired by the iconic Minecraft universe. Your objective is
            to explore, build, and mine while navigating through a 2D world.
        </p>

        <h2>Game Objectives</h2>
        <p>
            Survive a set number of nights while dealing with enemies that attack you. To survive, you'll need to strategize
            to fight off foes, gather resources to build protective structures, and explore the environment for valuable
            treasures and secrets.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can customize your experience by building your own home, crafting weapons and tools, and maintaining your
            health. Exploration opens up new opportunities and challenges, providing an exciting experience as you adapt and
            overcome obstacles in a pixelated landscape.
